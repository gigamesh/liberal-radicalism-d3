  2: "<p>In U.S. national party primaries, public financing is available to candidates who meet certain guidelines. During a specified time period, the candidates collect donations from their supporters. After the time period ends, each candidate is eligible to receive a portion of public funds based on each candidate's total receipts.</p><p>The problem with this system is that it doesn't account for how many donors contributed -- only the total dollar amount. For example, if a million individual donors each contribute a dollar to one candidate, and a single donor contributes a million dollars to a different candidate, both candidates would receive the same amount of public funds. <p>In the U.S.A, this problem is imperfectly confronted by enforcing an arbitrary $2,700 limit per candidate, per donor.</p>",
  3: "<p>In the 2016 primary, Hillary Clinton received the largest <em>total</em> donations while Bernie Sanders received the most <em>individual</em> donations.</p><p>Each green dot in the chart represents approximately 3,700 donations and the legend on the left lists their respective donation ranges. The yellow dots represent the portion of public funds made available to each candidate. The public funds help each candidate proportional to their total receipts and don't change the competitive balance between candidates, giving wealthy donors a significant advantage.</p>",
