  2: "<p>Imagine an election between Alice, Bill and Carl in a country using a typical public financing scheme in which all donations collected during a specified campaign period are matched dollar-for-dollar up to an arbitrary limit. Assume each candidate has met all the criteria to receive public funding.</p>",
  3: "<p>For the sake of demonstration, we'll assume donations are matched up to $2,700 (this is the current cap per donor in U.S. national elections, however donations are only matched up to $250. For our purposes, it will be more illustrative to assume the matching extends to $2,700).</p><p> There are multiple problems with dollar-for-dollar matching schemes like these: a high donation limit allows wealthy donors to exert more influence, but if the cap is set too low, those donors are motivated to exert influence through less transparent means (lobbying, \"Super PACs\", etc). And rather than being set by rigorous economics, the donation caps are fairly arbitrary and at the mercy of whoever is currently in power.</p><p> Lastly, if not administered well in coordination with other aspects of election laws, the system can cease being useful over time (ex: Most presidential hopefuls in the U.S.A. haven't accepted public funding for over a decade).</p>",
  4: "<p>Imagine each green dot in the chart represents 1,000 donations in dollar ranges specified by the legend on the left. The yellow dots represent the portion of public funds made available to each candidate after the initial donation period. The public funds help each candidate proportional to their total receipts, but they don't change the competitive balance between candidates, giving wealthy donors a significant advantage.</p>",
