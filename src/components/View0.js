    <p>
      Liberal Radicalism (a.k.a. Quadratic Finance) is an economic mechanism for
      incentivizing the distributed funding of chronically underfunded public
      goods. Vital categories like open-source software, scientific research,
      journalism, and political campaigns all stand to benefit from adopting an
      L.R. funding scheme. If deployed widely, it could help alleviate the
      fundamental conflicts between democracy and capitalism.
