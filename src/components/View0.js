    <p>
      Liberal Radicalism (a.k.a. Quadratic Finance) is a funding mechanism
      developed in 2018 by Vitalik Buterin, ZoÃ« Hitzig and E. Glen Weyl.
    </p>
    <p>
      By fluidly incentivizing distributed funding of vital public goods such as
      infrastructure, open-source software, scientific research, journalism, and
      political campaigns, it has the potential to reduce chronic conflicts
      between democracy and capitalism
