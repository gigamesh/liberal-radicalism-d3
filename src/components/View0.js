    <p>
      Liberal Radicalism (a.k.a. Quadratic Finance) is a mechanism for optimally
      funding public goods, developed in 2018 by Vitalik Buterin, ZoÃ« Hitzig and
      E. Glen Weyl.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has the potential to reduce chronic conflicts between democracy and
      capitalism by incentivizing distributed funding of vital public goods such
      as infrastructure, open-source software, scientific research, journalism,
      and political campaigns.
